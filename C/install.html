				<font size="4"><a name="updates"></a><b>Installing Linux Lite to your 
				computer<br>
				</b></font><br>
				Start your computer, and go into your system Bios and check 
				that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set 
				to boot first. This varies from bios to bios. Refer to your 
				motherboard documentation for more information.<br>
				Once you are happy with your bios set up, insert the DVD disc or 
				USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You&#39;ll 
				be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if 
				you want to boot to the Live session.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/boot1.png"><p>
				Press any key to see the next screen.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/boot2.png"><p>
				Make sure <b>Start Linux Lite</b> is highlighted, press the 
				enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good 
				way to check that all of your hardware is supported. If you are 
				having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the 
				second option, <b>Start Linux Lite in safe graphics mode</b>.<p>
				The other options are:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Run memtest</b> - Test your computer memory for faults.<br>
				<b>Boot the first hard disk</b> - boot the existing operating 
				system.<p>
				<b>NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after 
				installation, 
				please read through <a href="hardware.html#booting">this trouble 
				shooting guide</a>.<br>
				</b><br>
				The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take 
				anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on 
				your hardware. The login for the Live user is automatic, there 
				is no need to login. An explanation of the various Menu&#39;s can be 
				found by clicking <a href="index.html#menus">here</a>.<p>
				Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection 
				first. Click <a href="network.html">here</a> if you need help to 
				get online before you install Linux Lite.<p>
				Once you&#39;ve had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to 
				install the first step is to double click on the <b>Install Linux Lite</b> 
				icon on your Desktop.
				<p><img src="img/installer/installicon.png" alt="" />
              <p>The installer will then open on the desktop and display the <b>Welcome</b> section of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite.<p><img src="img/installer/1-language.png" alt="" />
	            <p>After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. 
				<b>NOTE: Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory.</b><p><img src="img/installer/2-prepare.png" alt="" />                                                
	            <p>Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer.<p>
				<b>Install Linux alongside Windows</b> - otherwise known as a 
				dual boot. An option to boot from Windows or Linux Lite when 
				your computer starts.<br>
				<b>Replace Windows with Linux</b> - completely replace Windows 
				with Linux Lite.<br>
				<b>Something else</b> - a more advanced option. Manually set 
				each partition size.
	            <p><img src="img/installer/3-selectinstall.png" alt="" /><p><strong>Erase Disk and Install Linux</strong>                
	            <p>Upon selecting Erase Disk and Install Linux you are presented with a screen displaying how your install will be represented on the hard disk. This is the most simple option available and will show your hard disk being completely and solely occupied by Linux Lite. You may select the disk you wish to install Linux Lite to from the menu 
				labeled: <b>Select Drive</b>. You may then select <b>Install Now</b> when you are ready to begin installing.<p><img src="img/installer/3c-replaceinstall.png" alt="" />                                                
	            <p><strong>Install Linux alongside Windows</strong>                
	            <p>If you have selected to install Linux Lite alongside an existing copy of Windows, you will be greeted with a screen representing the two operating systems on the disk. You may choose the disk to install Linux Lite to from the top menu labeled: 
				<b>Select Drive</b>. In the main part of the window you will see your hard disk split into two sections, one containing your Windows install and one for your proposed Linux Lite installation. You may drag the empty space between them to allocate space from one to the other as needed. You may then select 
				<b>Install Now</b> after you have made the desired changes.<p><img src="img/installer/3b-installalong.png" alt="" />                                                
	            <p><strong>Something Else</strong><p><strong>NOTE: FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY</strong><p>If the other methods do not fulfill your personal requirements for installation you may select 
				<b>Something Else</b> and manually partition your hard disk. There are many options available from this screen. All of your disks will be visible in a hierarchal tree view in the main window. From here you can see disk devices, existing partitions, and unallocated space. If your disk is new or you are creating a new install in a virtual machine you may need to select 
				<b>New Partition Table</b> from the options below. This will erase the disk and provide you with a clean slate. <strong>WARNING</strong>: This will destroy any data on the disk selected! Another option is to add a partition to the disk by selecting 
				<b>Add</b> from the button options. This option requires that there exists free space on the disk with which to create the partition. When adding a partition, you may select the place on the disk to create the partition, the partition size, the filesystem type, and the point in the filesystem that this partition will be mounted. If you need to modify these attributes of a partition, you may select 
				<b>Change</b> from the button options. If there exists partitions that you wish to be rid of, you can select 
				<b>Delete</b> from the button options to delete the partition. If you wish to return everything back to its original state you may use the 
				<b>Revert</b> button. <strong>NOTE</strong><b>: This will only 
				work if you have not written changes to the disk.</b><p>Under the partitioner there is a menu for selecting the location of the boot loader's installation. You may select a drive's MBR, indicated by the device name e.g. /dev/sda, or you may select a partition to install the boot loader to. The safest option is to install the bootloader to the MBR of the first disk as the bootloader will intelligently add 
				entries for installations of Windows and other Linux installs.<p>
				<strong>NOTE: If you have any NTFS drives, it is important to 
				give these a mount point during the install. That way they will 
				be easily accessible after the installation.</strong><p><img src="img/installer/3a-manualinstall.png" alt="" />                                                
              <p>After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below.
              <p><img src="img/installer/4-timezone.png" alt="" />                                          
              <p>The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later.<p><img src="img/installer/5-keyboardlayout.png" alt="" />                                          
              <p>On the next screen, you are greeted by several forms to fill. These forms include:<p>
				<b>Your name</b> - your personal name.<br>
				<b>Your computer&#39;s name</b> - the name that you wish to use to 
				identify the computer on your network.<br>
				<b>Pick a username</b> - your user name that is used to login to 
				the system.<br>
				<b>Choose a password</b> - your password that you wish to use 
				for your user and sudo password.<br>
				<b>Confirm your password</b> - enter the above password again.<p>
				<b>NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case 
				as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this 
				would be: <span class="auto-style2">y%9L2x#o</span> would be 
				considered a strong password. Use a program like
				<a href="https://www.keepassx.org/" target="_blank">Keepassx</a> 
				to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same 
				password for different websites.<br />
				<br />
				Never compromise your security for convenience.</b><p>&nbsp;There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. Finally, there is a selection for encrypting your user's Home folder for extra security.<p><img src="img/installer/6-userinfo.png" alt="" />                                          
              <p>If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen asking to 
				&#39;Take a photo&#39; this feature is not supported.<br>
				After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window.<p>
				<img alt="slide" height="537" src="img/installer/7-slideshow.png" width="754" />                                          
              <p>Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. 
			  If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4.<p><img src="img/installer/8-finished.png" alt="" />

				Fortunately setting it again is fairly straight forward.<br>
				Lets begin.<p>
				Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the 
				Shift key. You should see a screen like this.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/pass1.png"><p>
				Next press the <b>e</b> key whilst that top line is highlighted. This 
				will take you to the next screen.<br>
				Use your arrow keys to move down to the line highlighted in the 
				picture below. Use the arrow key until you reach the end of that 
				line.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/pass2.png"><p>
				Press the backspace key repeatedly until you remove: <b>ro 
				splash quiet $vt_handoff </b>and replace that<br>
				text with:<b> rw init=/bin/bash </b>so that it looks like the 
				picture below.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/pass3.png"><p>
				Now press either <b>F10</b> or <b>Ctrl+X</b> to boot your 
				machine to a command prompt.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/pass4.png"><p>
				At the prompt, type: <b>passwd jerry</b> where <b>jerry</b> is 
				your username, then press enter.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/pass5.png"><p>
				You will be asked to type in a new password twice.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/pass6.png"><p>
				Your password has now been changed. Now we are ready to save 
				those changes, then reboot the computer.<br>
				Type in: <b>sync</b> then hit enter. Then type in: <b>reboot -f</b><p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/pass7.png"><p>
				Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below 
				again, just hit enter. This is normal and won&#39;t appear the next 
				time you reboot your computer. You may also not see the boot 
				animation on this boot, this to is normal and will reappear next

				Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won&#39;t have to 
				venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some 
				occasions where we need to run the odd terminal command. The 
				following is a very basic introduction to some of the more 
				common terminal commands that will help you to navigate around 
				your computer, should you need to.<p>
				<b>TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or 
				folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this 
				will auto complete the name. This will save you lots of time but 
				be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. 
				In the examples below &#39;directory&#39; also means &#39;folder&#39;.</b><p>
				<b>ls</b> - display a list of files in the current directory<p>
				<b>ls -la</b> - a more comprehensive display of file properties 
				in the current directory, including hidden files<p>
				<b>pwd</b> - shows you the current directory you are in<p>
				<b>cd</b> - change directory, change to another directory<p>
				<b>cd ..</b> - go back one directory<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics1.png"><p>
				<b>cp</b> - copy file to another directory<p>
				<b>rm</b> - remove a file or directory<p>
				<b>rm -rf</b> - permanently delete a file or directory<p>
				<b>mv</b> - rename a file or directory.<br>
				You can also use it to move a file from one location to another 
				eg. <b>mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents</b><p>
				<b>cat</b> - display the contents inside a file<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics2.png"><p>
				<b>mkdir</b> - make a new folder<p>
				<b>rmdir</b> - remove a folder<p>
				<b>killall</b> - kill a program with that name<p>
				<b>man</b> - read the manual for a particular program (type <b>q</b> 
				to exit the manual)<p>

				The default icon set is <b>Faenza</b>.<br>
				There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite. Go 
				to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>.<br>
				There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of 
				these settings - <b>Appearance</b> and <b>Window Manager</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/installer/themes1.png"></p>
				<p><br>
				Click on <b>Appearance</b>. Here you will see the <b>Style</b>

				<p><img border="0" src="img/installer/themes3.png"></p>
				<p>As you click through the various themes and icon sets you 
				will notice visual changes on your computer.<br>
				Close <b>Settings Manager</b> before moving onto the next part

				<p>Head over to the

				XFCE Look</a> website and choose theme of your liking.</p>
				<p><b>NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would 
				expect, please read all of the documentation before attempting 
				to apply a new theme. Some make installation easy via a PPA, 
				this is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click
				<a href="software.html#ppa">here</a> for more information on how 
				to install a new PPA. Whichever theme you choose, make sure that 
				it mentions XFCE compatability.</b></p>
				<p>The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click 
				on <b>View, Show Hidden Files</b>.<br>
				Right click somewhere in your home folder, <b>Create Folder</b>, 
				make a folder called <b>.themes </b>(you will only need to do 
				this once.) This is where we will copy the new theme to.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes4.png"></p>
				<p>Download a theme of your choosing. In this example we will 
				choose the 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Redbird?content=158228">Redbird</a> theme.</p>
				<p><b>NOTE: Each theme may come with a specific set of

				<p>Next extract the theme you just downloaded (right click,
				<b>Extract Here</b>)</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes5.png"></p>
				<p>Copy the Redbird theme folder to the <b>.themes</b> folder in your 
				home folder.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes6.png"></p>
				<p>Now go to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>. There are

				<b>Window Manager</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes7.png"></p>
				<p>First we&#39;ll click into <b>Appearance</b>. Select <b>Redbird</b>

				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes8.png"></p>
				<p>Click on <b>Overview</b> in the bottom left to go back to the
