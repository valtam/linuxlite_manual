				Check out our Hardware Database

				you can also run Linux Lite live before you install it to see if 
				your hardware is supported. This database feature is new so the 
				list of computers at the moment is limited. If you already have 
				Linux Lite installed, please consider adding your hardware to

				<p>The following is an independently maintained PPA by Stefan 
				Glasenhardt. As such you should research first and then decide if you 
				want to use this PPA. The standard installed Ubuntu Intel drivers work 
				fine, by using this PPA, you may gain a little more performance and 
				better framerates.<br />
				<br />
				A word from Stefan:</p>
				<p><em><strong>This only supports Intel i810 chipset and up. 
				Others such as GMA 500 … are not supported. And also remember 
				that, these are ‘hot’ updates and might contain bugs, so please 
				use it at your own risk.</strong></em></p>
				<p>More information here:
				<a href="https://launchpad.net/~glasen/+archive/intel-driver" target="_blank">
				https://launchpad.net/~glasen/+archive/intel-driver</a> </p>
				<p>To install these drivers, open up a terminal and type:&nbsp;</p>

				<b>NOTE: You must be connected to the internet before you start

				If you plan to play Steam games in the future or have an extremely new Nvidia card, select:<br>

<p>
1. The audio icon can be found in the lower right hand corner, commonly referred to as the system tray.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/icons.png"><br>
<br>
2.  Hovering over the icon will show you the volume currently set. If you left click it, 
it will toggle mute and unmute for the <b>Master</b> volume. Volume can also be adjusted up and down my using your mouse scroll wheel whilst hovering over the icon. Scrolling up brings the master volume up, and down accordingly.
<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio2.png"><br>
<br>
3. Right clicking on the sound icon will bring you a menu with a few options, you can select 
<b>Properties</b> to adjust a few options.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio3.png"><br>
<br>
4. You can select <b>Sound card, Mixer</b>, and what command the left click uses. 
Generally you will not need to adjust any of the settings aside from selecting 
<b>Sound card</b>.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio4.png"><br>
</p>

<p>
5. If you&#39;re unable to hear any sound, or you just want to check and adjust settings, 
you would need to open the audio settings with <b>PulseAudio Volume Control</b>.<br>
<br>
Navigate to the <b>Menu</b>, <b>Multimedia</b>, <b>PulseAudio Volume Control</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio10.png"><br>
<br>
6. You will be brought to a window similar to this one. On the tabs you will see <b>Playback</b>, for adjusting the volume of programs currently playing or capable of playback. <b>Recording</b> for programs currently using recording devices, namely your microphone. <b>Output Devices</b> is for main configuration of sound levels across your system. <b>Configuration</b> 
is used for selecting profiles and misc settings.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio11.png"><br>
<br>
7. In the window above you can adjust volume settings for output. Using the blue sliding bars. You can toggle mute with the speaker icon <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio19.png"> It will change it's background color when active <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio18.png">. You can lock channels using <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio20.png"> 
so that when volume is raised or lowered it is done 
equally. Or you can toggle and set the volume to be louder on one side. The <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio21.png"> icon is used to specify the default device used by 
PulseAudio. <br>
<br>
8. <b>Input Devices</b>, this includes microphones and other line-in devices, such as TV tuner cards with line in. Adjusting the levels and settings are the same method as described above in section 7.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio12.png"><br>

<br>
9. <b>Configuration</b>, this lists known profiles for your sound card. In most cases there is no need to select anything here unless you intend to disable your sound completely, or have a unique profile setting, 
such as surround sound, mono, or 
stereo out.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio13.png"><br>

<br>
10. <b>Recording</b>, will list programs currently using an input method, be it line-in or a microphone. You can toggle access per program and 
or adjust volume per program here. The method used is the same as mentioned in section 7.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio15.png"><br>
<br>
11. <b>Playback</b>, will list programs currently producing audio or able to. You can toggle access per program and 
or adjust volume per program here. The method used is the same as mentioned in section 7.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio14.png"><br>
<br>
12. <b>Notes</b>: Being able to toggle on mute and unmute on multiple things can cause issues. And at times the device may be muted upon install. Show caution here as you may mute a certain program and forget about it entirely. If unmuting and adjusting settings for your sound card and related programs do not work at all, there may be a driver issue. Refer below for resources on how to remedy this. You can find help by using the <b><a href="#report">Create System Report tool</a></b>

1. Plugging in a printer will prompt a dialog if detected and attempt to find a matching driver. (If your driver was 
plugged in during your initial install you may not see a prompt, you may refer to step 3 below.)<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/printer1.png"><br>
<br>
2. If a printer and driver has been detected you will see this dialog. (Note, the dialog should appear in 
upper right of your screen)<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/printer2.png"><br>
<br>
3. You can further configure or manage printing jobs or printers by going to printing located in 
<b>Menu, System, Printing</b>.<br>

4. Once you open the <b>Printing</b> menu it will bring you to a simple dialog to select, view and manage options related to your printer.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/printer4.png"><br>
<br>
5. You can find options for a printer by highlighting (single clicking) on the icon of the printer you wish to manage.<br>
<br> 
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/printer7.png"><br> 
<br>
6. If a printer if not listed in the window after opening it you will need to plug in the device and click on the + sign located below the menu.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/printer9.png"><br> 
<br>
7. Once you click on the + sign above, you will see this window if the printer was detected properly. You can then select the method of connect and printer on the pane near the bottom of the window. (You may see more than one option if your device is an all in one device, so select from the left pane carefully.) From here you can also 
select a <b>Network Printer</b> if you are connected to a home network and a printer is available.<br>
<br>7.1 If for some reason you are unable to see a network printer on a machine using 
Windows you may need to configure samba (a sharing and networking tool for Linux > 
Windows) You can find help doing this 
<a target="_blank" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu">here</a>, as well as a thread for samba on the Linux Lite forums
