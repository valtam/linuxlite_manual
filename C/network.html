				<p>For the most part, you shouldn&#39;t have to configure anything 
				in <b>Network Connections</b> if you are connected to your 
				router with an ethernet cable. Your router is most likely 
				already set up to give you an IP address automatically. So in 
				this tutorial we will instead focus on connecting to your router 
				with a static IP address.</p>
				<p>Make sure <b>Enable Networking </b>has a tick beside it. The 
				first step is to right click on the network tray icon and select
				<b>Edit Connections</b>. You may be asked for your password 
				before you go to change any of your <b>Network Connection</b> 
				settings.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/network/wired1.png"></p>
				<p>A box will pop up with a number of tabs across the top, make 
				sure to select the <b>Wired</b> tab.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/network/wired2.png"></p>
				<p>Click on the <b>Add</b> button and a new box will pop up.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/network/wired3.png"></p>
				<p>Select the <b>IPv4 Settings</b> tab and then select <b>Manual</b> 
				from the <b>Method</b> drop down.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/network/wired4.png"></p>
				<p>Now click on the <b>Add</b> button, click into the first 
				field - <b>Address</b> and populate it with the relevant IP 
				details from your network (see your Router Manual for details) 
				this will vary from brand to brand of router. Continue to 
				populate the remaining <b>Netmask</b> and <b>Gateway</b> fields 
				with the relevant IP details from your network.</p>
				<p><b>Address</b> - The IP address you will give to your Linux 
				Lite computer (refer to your router manual for the exact 
				details)<br>
				<b>Netmask</b> - Nearly always <b>255.255.255.0</b> (refer to 
				your router manual for the exact details)<br>
				<b>Gateway</b> - This is the IP address of your router (refer to 
				your router manual for the exact details)</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/network/wired5.png"></p>
				<p>Once you have entered all the IP details, click on <b>Save</b> 
				and then <b>Close</b> on the final box.</p>

				<p>In the system tray (near the clock, bottom right hand side of 
				your screen) if you have no connection at the moment you will 
				see a diagonal broken line with a red cross next to it. This denotes 
				that there is no connection currently. Left click on the icon, 
				if your wireless is working, you should have a list of wireless 
				networks in your area, select your network. If you cannot see 
				any wireless networks at all, your wireless device driver may 
				not be installed, or for example your wireless switch on your 
				laptop is in the Off position. If after you have checked this 
				there are still no wireless networks showing, go to <b>Menu, Settings, 
				Install Drivers</b> and see if your wireless device is listed. 
				If it is, install the driver for it and continue with this 
				tutorial.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/network/wireless-1.png"></p>
				<p>A box will pop up asking for your wireless password. If you 
				would like to view your password while you type it, tick the &#39;<b>Show 
				password</b>&#39; box to ensure that you have entered your wireless 
				password correctly.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/network/wireless-2.png"></p>
				<p>After a successful connection, you should see a tray icon 
				like the one shown below with 4 bars in total. The signal strength is 
				displayed by the number of bars. The more bars in bold, the stronger the 
				signal. In this example we are connected with 3 out of the 4 
				bars.</p>

				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="nas"></a>Accessing a NAS device</font></b></p>
				<p>Many homes now use a NAS or Network Attached Storage device.<br />
				In this tutorial we'll show you how to access all your media 
				files, then show you how to play them across your network with 
				VLC.<br />
				When this set up is complete, you'll also be able to copy and 
				paste files between your NAS and your pc just like you did in 
				Windows or Mac.</p>
				<p>First thing you need to do is find the IP address of your 
				NAS. You may know this already or your NAS manual will show you 
				how to find this. Once you have your NAS's IP address, open up 
				your home folder and type in the following:</p>
				<p><strong>smb://192.168.0.5</strong> where 192.168.0.5 is your 
				NAS's IP address.</p>
				<p>
				<img height="460" src="img/network/nas/nas1.png" width="711" /></p>
				<p>Put in the username of the NAS, in most cases it is <strong>
				admin</strong>, but again refer to your manual for the correct 
				information.<br />
				Put in the workgroup (<strong>Domain</strong>) name, and finally 
				the password for your NAS. Place a dot in <strong>Remember 
				forever</strong> if you want it to save your details.</p>
				<p>
				<img height="458" src="img/network/nas/nas2.png" width="709" /></p>
				<p>You should now see all of your NAS folders.</p>
				<p>
				<img height="460" src="img/network/nas/nas3.png" width="711" /></p>
				<p>Lets look inside the <strong>Movies</strong> folder for this device, as you 
				can see I have a movie file in there called <strong>The Code 
				Linux Historical Documentary.mp4</strong></p>
				<p>
				<img height="460" src="img/network/nas/nas4.png" width="711" /></p>
				<p>Before we can start playing media files across the network, 
				we need to set up VLC so that it can access and play files 
				remotely.<br />
				In Linux Lite, click on <strong>Menu, Multimedia, VLC Media 
				Player</strong>. With VLC open, click on <strong>Tools, 
				Preferences</strong>.</p>
				<p>
				<img height="356" src="img/network/nas/nas5.png" width="443" /></p>
				<p>In the window that pops up, in the bottom left click on <strong>
				All</strong>. Then on the left, expand <strong>Input / Codecs, 
				Access modules, SMB</strong>. Then put in your NAS's username, 
				password and finally the <strong>SMB domain</strong> 
				(Workgroup). Click on <strong>Save</strong> to finish and close 
				VLC.</p>
				<p>
				<img height="545" src="img/network/nas/nas6.png" width="684" /></p>
				<p>Now that we've given VLC the network credentials it needs to 
				access your NAS, we can browse and play our files.</p>

				<a name="shares"></a><p><b><font size="4">Network Shares: Menu, 
				System, Network Share Settings</font></b></p>
				<p>Assuming you have already set up shares on your Windows 
				computer, please read through the following guide.<br>
				Accessing shares between Linux and Windows computers 
				historically has been difficult, it doesn&#39;t always work out. In 
				this tutorial we hope to make the process a little easier for 
				you. First step, we 
				need to set up your Linux Lite shares.</p>
				<p><a name="folder">Create</a> a folder in your home folder and place into it files 
				that you want to share with your Windows computer.</p>
				<p>Right click on your home folder, <b>Create Folder</b>. Now 
				give your new folder a name, in this example we&#39;ll use the name &#39;<b>share</b>&#39;.</p>
				<p>Next we need to tell Windows who we are going to login as 
				to access our Linux Lite shares.<br>
				<a name="usersetup">Open</a> up a terminal and type:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table6" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td>sudo smbpasswd -a <b>name</b></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p><br>
				where <b>name</b> is your Linux Lite username.<br>
				After that, you&#39;ll be asked to enter your Linux Lite password 
				twice.</p>
				<p>Now, in the same terminal do:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table7" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td>sudo leafpad /etc/samba/smbusers</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p><br>
				where you see:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table8" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td>&lt;name&gt; = “&lt;name&gt;”</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p><br>
				replace <b>name</b> with your Linux Lite username in each of the 
				brackets, eg.</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table9" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td>&lt;jerry&gt; = “&lt;jerry&gt;”</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p><br>
				<b>Save</b> and <b>Close</b> the file, and close the terminal. 
				You will only ever need to do this part <b>once</b>.</p>
				<p>Now click on <b>Menu, System, Network Share Settings, Edit 
				Network Shares</b>, and 
				follow very carefully the onscreen instructions. Do not miss any 
				steps and take your time. A text editor will pop up with content 
				similar to that of the example below. Only change the text that 
				is in <b>bold</b>.</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table1" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
