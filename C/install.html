          <p>Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select 
		  the iso file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this 
		  will greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can 
		  sometimes happen. A 4x speed is recommended if you have it.</p>

          <p> &nbsp;</p>
          <p> <font size="4"><a name="install"></a><b>Installing Linux Lite to 
		  your computer<br />
              </b></font><br />
            Start your computer, and go into your system Bios and check that the 
		  boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first. 
		  This varies from bios to bios. Refer to your motherboard documentation 
		  for more information.<br />
            Once you are happy with your bios set up, insert the DVD disc or USB 
		  stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted 
		  with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot 
		  to the Live session.</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/boot1.png" /></p>
          <p> Press any key to see the next screen.</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/boot2.png" /></p>
          <p> Make sure <b>Start Linux Lite</b> is highlighted, press the enter 
		  key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that 
		  all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting 
		  and you get just a black screen, try the second option, <b>Start Linux 
		  Lite in safe graphics mode</b>.</p>
          <p> The other options are:<br />
            <br />
            <b>Run memtest</b> - Test your computer memory for faults.<br />
            <b>Boot the first hard disk</b> - boot the existing operating 
		  system.</p>
          <p> <b>NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after 
		  installation, please read through <a href="hardware.html#booting">this 
		  trouble shooting guide</a>.<br />
            </b><br />
            The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take 
		  anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your 
		  hardware. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need 
		  to login. An explanation of the various Menu's can be found by 
		  clicking <a href="index.html#menus">here</a>.</p>
          <p> Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection 
		  first. Click <a href="network.html">here</a> if you need help to get 
		  online before you install Linux Lite.</p>
          <p> Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install 
		  the first step is to double click on the <b>Install Linux Lite</b>
            icon on your Desktop. </p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/installicon.png" /> </p>
          <p>The installer will then open on the desktop and display the <b>
		  Welcome</b>
            section of the installer. From here you will select your preferred 
		  language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/1-language.png" /> </p>
          <p>After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements 
		  for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by 
		  viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any 
		  available updates while installing or install third-party software 
		  during the installation. <b>NOTE: Please verify the legal status of 
		  the use of the third party software in your country/territory.</b></p>
          <p><b>NOTE: </b>Generally we don't recommend ticking <b>Download 
		  updates while installing</b> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		  Install the third-party software</span> as this will significantly 
		  slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is 
		  recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install 
		  on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 
		  2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/2-prepare.png" /> </p>
          <p>Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to 
		  your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the 
		  installer.</p>
          <p> <b>Install Linux alongside Windows</b> - otherwise known as a dual 
		  boot. An option to boot from Windows or Linux Lite when your computer 
		  starts.<br />
            <b>Replace Windows with Linux</b> - completely replace Windows with 
		  Linux Lite.<br />
            <b>Something else</b> - a more advanced option. Manually set each 
		  partition size. </p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3-selectinstall.png" /></p>
          <p><strong>Erase Disk and Install Linux</strong> </p>
          <p>Upon selecting Erase Disk and Install Linux you are presented with 
		  a screen displaying how your install will be represented on the hard 
		  disk. This is the most simple option available and will show your hard 
		  disk being completely and solely occupied by Linux Lite. You may 
		  select the disk you wish to install Linux Lite to from the menu 
		  labeled: <b>Select Drive</b>. You may then select <b>Install Now</b>
            when you are ready to begin installing.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3c-replaceinstall.png" /> </p>
          <p><strong>Install Linux alongside Windows (dual booting)</strong></p>
          <p>If you have selected to install Linux Lite alongside an existing 
		  copy of Windows, you will be greeted with a screen representing the 
		  two operating systems on the disk. You may choose the disk to install 
		  Linux Lite to from the top menu labeled: <b>Select Drive</b>. In the 
		  main part of the window you will see your hard disk split into two 
		  sections, one containing your Windows install and one for your 
		  proposed Linux Lite installation. You may drag the empty space between 
		  them to allocate space from one to the other as needed. You may then 
		  select <b>Install Now</b> after you have made the desired changes.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3b-installalong.png" /> </p>
          <p><strong>Something Else</strong></p>
          <p><strong>NOTE: FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY</strong></p>
          <p>If the other methods do not fulfill your personal requirements for 
		  installation you may select <b>Something Else</b> and manually 
		  partition your hard disk. There are many options available from this 
		  screen. All of your disks will be visible in a hierarchal tree view in 
		  the main window. From here you can see disk devices, existing 
		  partitions, and unallocated space. If your disk is new or you are 
		  creating a new install in a virtual machine you may need to select <b>
		  New Partition Table</b> from the options below. This will erase the 
		  disk and provide you with a clean slate. <strong>WARNING</strong>: 
		  This will destroy any data on the disk selected! Another option is to 
		  add a partition to the disk by selecting <b>Add</b> from the button 
		  options. This option requires that there exists free space on the disk 
		  with which to create the partition. When adding a partition, you may 
		  select the place on the disk to create the partition, the partition 
		  size, the filesystem type, and the point in the filesystem that this 
		  partition will be mounted. If you need to modify these attributes of a 
		  partition, you may select <b>Change</b>
            from the button options. If there exists partitions that you wish to 
		  be rid of, you can select <b>Delete</b> from the button options to 
		  delete the partition. If you wish to return everything back to its 
		  original state you may use the <b>Revert</b> button. <strong>NOTE</strong><b>: 
		  This will only work if you have not written changes to the disk.</b></p>
          <p>Under the partitioner there is a menu for selecting the location of 
		  the boot loader's installation. You may select a drive's MBR, 
		  indicated by the device name e.g. /dev/sda, or you may select a 
		  partition to install the boot loader to. The safest option is to 
		  install the bootloader to the MBR of the first disk as the bootloader 
		  will intelligently add entries for installations of Windows and other 
		  Linux installs.</p>
          <p> <strong>NOTE: If you have any NTFS drives, it is important to give 
		  these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily 
		  accessible after the installation.</strong></p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3a-manualinstall.png" /> </p>
          <p>After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you 
		  are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The 
		  installer will continue to work in the background while you are 
		  filling out this information. The first step is to select your time 
		  zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location 
		  via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by 
		  either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in 
		  your area in the box below. </p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/4-timezone.png" /> </p>
          <p>The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You 
		  may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left 
		  and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you 
		  may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, 
		  these options may be changed later.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/5-keyboardlayout.png" /> </p>
          <p>On the next screen, you are greeted by several forms to fill. These 
		  forms include:</p>
          <p> <b>Your name</b> - your personal name.<br />
            <b>Your computer's name</b> - the name that you wish to use to 
		  identify the computer on your network.<br />
            <b>Pick a username</b> - your user name that is used to login to the 
		  system.<br />
            <b>Choose a password</b> - your password that you wish to use for 
		  your user and sudo password.<br />
            <b>Confirm your password</b> - enter the above password again.</p>
          <p> <b>NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case 
		  as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would 
		  be: <span class="auto-style2">y%9L2x#o</span> would be considered a 
		  strong password. Use a program like <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.keepassx.org/">Keepassx</a> to keep all your 
		  passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different 
		  websites.<br />
              <br />
              Never compromise your security for convenience.</b></p>
          <p>Â&nbsp;There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have 
		  the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. Finally, 
		  there is a selection for encrypting your user's Home folder for extra 
		  security.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/6-userinfo.png" /> </p>
          <p>If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install 
		  asking to 'Take a photo' this feature is supported so that when you 
		  first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip 
		  this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to <strong>
		  .face</strong>
            and place it in your <strong>/home/user</strong> folder.<br />
            After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a 
		  slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included 
		  in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own 
		  or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the 
		  window.</p>
          <p> <img width="754" height="537" src="img/installer/7-slideshow.png"
              alt="slide" /> </p>
          <p>Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either 
		  restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite 
		  system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB 
		  that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, 
		  press F4.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/8-finished.png" /> </p>
          <p>After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen:</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/login.png" /></p>
          <p>After you have logged in you will see the desktop. Congratulations! 
		  Now that we've installed Linux Lite, lets take a look at what's 
		  available on the Menu by clicking <a href="index.html#menus">here</a>.</p>
          <p> <img width="802" height="599" src="img/installer/desktop.png" alt="desktop" />Â&nbsp;</p>
          <p><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
          <hr />
            <p> &nbsp;</p>
          <p> <font size="4"><a name="language"></a>Setting your Language</font></p>
          <p> You may want to set a system wide language, here's how to do it.</p>
          <p> Click on <strong>Menu, Settings, Language Support</strong>.</p>
          <p> <img src="img/installer/lang/lang1.png" /></p>
          <p> You will get one of two boxes pop up like the ones below, follow 
		  the instructions by clicking on either <strong>Update</strong> or <strong>
		  Install</strong>.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang2.png" /></p>
          <p> <img src="img/installer/lang/lang3.png" /></p>
          <p> You will then be prompted for your password, enter it to continue.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang4.png" /></p>
          <p> Now click on the button <strong>Install / Remove Languages</strong>.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang5.png" /></p>
          <p> In this example, we'll install the <strong>Portuguese</strong>
            language. Scroll down, find your language and tick the box next to 
		  it, then click on <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang6.png" /></p>
          <p> Your computer will begin to download all the language files, this 
		  may take a while.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang7.png" /></p>
          <p> Once that is done, scroll to the bottom of the <strong>Language 
		  for menus and windows</strong> box and drag your newly installed 
		  language to the top of the list. Then click on <strong>Apply 
		  System-Wide</strong>, you'll be prompted for your password again.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang8.png" /></p>
          <p> Now click on the <strong>Regional Formats</strong> tab, select the 
		  language you just installed, and click on <strong>Apply System-Wide</strong>.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang9.png" /></p>
          <p> Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language 
		  has been applied.</p>
          <p> <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/lang10.png" /></p>
          <p> Please note that not all programs may not have your language 
		  applied. If this is the case, search for that program in <strong>
              Install/Remove Software</strong> and see if there is a language 
		  pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your 
		  language, some of the <strong>Menu</strong> items may not be 
		  translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way 
		  to rename <strong>Menu</strong> entries is by going to <strong>Menu, 
		  Settings, Main Menu</strong> and editing the entries there.</p>

            Open a terminal and type: <strong>sudo blkid</strong><br />

            followed by your password. This will output the uuid's for all your 
		  hard drives.<br />
            <br />
            Take the uuid for that drive and place it into /etc/fstab, first we

            <strong>sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak</strong><br />

            Lets begin.</p>
          <p> Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the 
		  Shift key. You should see a screen like this.</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/pass1.png" /></p>

          <p> Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below

			<p> <font size="4"><a name="terminal"></a><b>Terminal Basics</b></font></p>
          <p> Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to 
		  venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions 
		  where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very 
		  basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that 
		  will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to.</p>
          <p> <b>TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, 
		  type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto 
		  complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and 
		  make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below 
		  'directory' also means 'folder'.</b></p>
          <p> <b>ls</b> - display a list of files in the current directory</p>
          <p> <b>ls -la</b> - a more comprehensive display of file properties in 
		  the current directory, including hidden files</p>
          <p> <b>pwd</b> - shows you the current directory you are in</p>
          <p> <b>cd</b> - change directory, change to another directory</p>
          <p> <b>cd ..</b> - go back one directory</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics1.png" /></p>
          <p> <b>cp</b> - copy file to another directory</p>
          <p> <b>rm</b> - remove a file or directory</p>
          <p> <b>rm -rf</b> - permanently delete a file or directory</p>
          <p> <b>mv</b> - rename a file or directory.<br />
            You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg.
            <b>mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents</b></p>
          <p> <b>cat</b> - display the contents inside a file</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics2.png" /></p>
          <p> <b>mkdir</b> - make a new folder</p>
          <p> <b>rmdir</b> - remove a folder</p>
          <p> <b>killall</b> - kill a program with that name</p>
          <p> <b>man</b> - read the manual for a particular program (type <b>q</b>
            to exit the manual)</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics3.png" /></p>

            There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of

          <p><b>NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would expect,

              for more information on how to install a new PPA. Whichever theme

            Right click somewhere in your home folder, <b>Create Folder</b>, 
		  make a folder called <b>.themes </b>(you will only need to do this 
		  once.) This is where we will copy the new theme to.</p>
          <p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes4.png" /></p>
          <p>Download a theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose

          <p><b>NOTE: Each theme may come with a specific set of install 
		  instructions, if they do, please follow those instructions.</b></p>

		  home folder.</p>
          <p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes6.png" /></p>
          <p>Now go to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>. There are 2 
		  places we need to apply the new theme, <b>Appearance</b> and <b>Window 
		  Manager</b>.</p>
          <p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes7.png" /></p>
          <p>First we'll click into <b>Appearance</b>. Select <b>Redbird</b>
